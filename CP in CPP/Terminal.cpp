// to run in terminal


// THIS JUST BUILDS THE CODE(makes a .exe file if it doesn't exists already/ hasn't already been built)
// C:\Users\prince kumar BGR\Documents\CPP\CPP work> g++ filename.cpp -o filename

// now just type the filename or filename.exe to run the executable file 
// C:\Users\prince kumar BGR\Documents\CPP\CPP work>filename

// complete process
// C:\Users\prince kumar BGR\Documents\CPP\CPP work>g++ terminal.cpp -o terminal
// C:\Users\prince kumar BGR\Documents\CPP\CPP work>terminal

// ORRRRRRR (with .exe in the end)

// THIS JUST BUILDS THE CODE(makes a .exe file if it doesn't exists already)
// C:\Users\prince kumar BGR\Documents\CPP\CPP work>g++ terminal.cpp -o terminal.exe
// now just type the filename or filename.exe to run the executable file
// C:\Users\prince kumar BGR\Documents\CPP\CPP work>terminal


// with c, use gcc instead of g++ and extension as .c
// everything and every way/function is same with c also

// ********IF .exe file already exists(i.e the program has already been built), then simply type the filname without any extension(or with .exe extension) to run the executable file.
// ***** IF you type with extension(.c or .cpp), it'll open the code file instead of executable file
