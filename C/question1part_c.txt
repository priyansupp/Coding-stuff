The character Duke, develops very repulsive opinions on him during the play. One saying, that he is a liar, cheater and a blasphemer, considering it was immoral of him to give death rites to others. He impersonates lies, and counterfeits. He used to take control and manipulates things according to himself, like he intentionally did not tell Isabelle about his brother Claudia. Also, being a cleric, it was his prime duty to keep him away from despair, and coaching him, because he is about to go into great beyond to gain Godâ€™s grace, but instead he is using it as a manipulation to push him to the utmost psychological despair. It was as if he was playing God- impersonating a religious figure, which makes him a little bit repulsive for the audience. But I disagree. I believe that it was his stage-managing skills, self- importance and his controlling skills, which become a source of admiration for him. It was because of these skills, that he became a part of most happening incidents during the play. Also, while talking about Isabelle, he stated that she would feel much better about Claudia being alive, when she stops banging her head against the wall. Also, he took Claudia to the edge of the death, not to affect him psychologically, but to purify him, to get him through his sufferings and what society calls liberating and make him a better man in the end. It is the transparency of his acts, and that we are known that his acts are planned, which do not develop any hate for him from my end.
