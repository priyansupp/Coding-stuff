The scene sets at a point where Oedipus is bewildered and confused on the accusation of him being the murderer of his father and marrying his mother by Tiresias, the blind prophet. But to his natural instincts, he refused the accusations and laid the prophet and Creon with charges of conspiring against the king. Oedipus had one of the worst nightmares seeming to be true and was unwilling to believe it at any cost. All the prophecies and oracles set against him, and ready to prove he was the murderer of Laius, the previous king. The tranquility of his life lies in the fact and correctness of prophecies. To settle his rumbling thoughts, his wife Jocasta tries to prove the point of why prophecies can't be trusted and more often than not are wrong by referring to the incidence of how king Lauis was killed by the band of thieves on a three-way crossroad which in her point of view defies the prophecy of Lauis getting killed by his own son. Her sheer belief in the uselessness of the prophecies perforates from wrong assumptions she made on the life of Jocasta's and Lauis's three days old son. In this very consolation she seemed to offer Oedipus to settle his thoughts, she remained oblivious of how it is all coming to a focal point where it settles the prophecy for Oedipus to get true and marks him the murderer. All of Oedipus's past now gazes upon him and regardless of everything he tried to do, he couldn't overcome his fate set by gods.
