The three plays have dealt with the trials and testing part each unique in their own way. Oedipus Rex maintains the rivalry between destiny and free choice of a man. The play foresees how redundant is the choice of man in hands of fate. Even though one can try to chanage the prophecies by all his means and actions but everything will gets crushed at hands of fate and eventually it will fall to tragedy in life.
While Shakuntaka narrates quite a differenet perspective. Even though both plays are set of fate, Shakuntala's fate was not predecided by gods but it was set the moment she fell in love with the king. This signifies the importance  of love and its strength to overcome all the problems to get united at last. She met her fate with the king which was out of love she had for the king.
