In the play, Shakuntala by Kalidas the King addresses the situation whereafter he had lost his memory and love for Shakuntala due to the irreversible curse from Durvasas. The king is visited by two hermits and with them comes Shakuntala. He at this point was totally unaware of their marriage and the love he shared with Shakuntala and so he saw her as a normal woman, totally unrelated to him. Those who accompanied Shakuntala are Sharngarava and Sharadvata, the two pupils of Kanva who had come to drop off Shakuntala to the king for she had married him and was carrying his child in her womb. As when the king rejects her stating his unadulterated to any woman Sharngarava turns furious met by King's words to Sharngarava of how a king's honor remains in not keeping an eye on any woman who is not his and thus he must reject Shakuntala as he judges the child she carries is met by another man and not him. He compares the relationship between a man and a woman in the way how night flowers only open to the nightly shades of the moon and a day-blossom opens to the sun. And none of them ever betray the relationship they share with their celestial partners. So thus a wife must only be taken by his holy husband and not by any other man. This further sets the scene in tension and they finalize on waiting for the child to take birth so that they can know who's the rightful father.
